## üöÄ Getting Started

To use this repository effectively, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.
- **Text Editor/IDE**: Use any editor like VS Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text to view and run the code.
- **Git**: Install Git to clone the repository. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/didogrigorov/Python-Algorithmic-Problems.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Topic Folder**:
   Browse folders like `Arrays`, `Strings`, or `Dynamic_Programming`, and select a difficulty level (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`).

3. **Run a Solution**:
   Each `.py` file contains a standalone solution with input/output handling. Run it using Python:
   ```bash
   python Arrays/Easy/Two_Sum.py
   ```

4. **Study and Experiment**:
   - Read the comments in each file to understand the problem, approach, and solution.
   - Test the code with different inputs to explore edge cases.
   - Modify the code to try alternative algorithms or optimize performance.

5. **Explore Further**:
   - Cross-reference problems with their original platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank) for additional context.
   - Use the solutions as a reference after attempting problems on your own.

## üí° How to Use This Repository

This repository is versatile and can be used in various ways depending on your goals:

- **For Learning**:
  - Study the solutions to grasp fundamental and advanced algorithmic concepts.
  - Analyze Python implementations to learn syntax, data structures, and best practices.
  - Use the comments to understand the reasoning behind each solution.

- **For Practice**:
  - Attempt problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank first, then compare your solutions with those here.
  - Focus on specific topics (e.g., Graphs, Dynamic Programming) to strengthen weak areas.
  - Use the difficulty levels to progressively challenge yourself.

- **For Interview Preparation**:
  - Practice problems commonly asked in technical interviews, organized by topic and difficulty.
  - Study optimized solutions to learn time and space complexity trade-offs.
  - Simulate timed coding sessions by solving problems without referring to solutions initially.

- **For Teaching or Mentoring**:
  - Share solutions with students or peers to explain algorithmic concepts.
  - Use the repository as a reference for coding workshops or study groups.
